# FUZE! [version.1]
#
# An efficient script made by ME to speed shit up.
# The " root@D0loresH4ze:~/FUZE.sh# " part is editable, it's just cosmetics.
# For example you can put "Choose an Option: " Instead of that and the script will still work.
# Just make sure to only edit the text in between the apostrophes ( ' ' ) AND do NOT edit the " PS3= " part or the script may not work.
# =====================================================================================================================================
# To ADD your OWN options to this script, copy this: 
#
# ===========================================
#
#         "YourOption")
#             clear && YourCommand
#             ;;
#
# ===========================================
#
# And put it underneath or above another option's double semicolons Like this:
#
# ===========================================
#
#         "YourOption")
#             clear && YourCommand
#             ;;
#         "AnotherOption")
#             clear && AnotherCommand
#             ;;
#
# ===========================================
#
# After that, add "YourOption" to the " options=( " part under " PS3=' " with a single space from right and left between the other options.
# Make sure that your new option is in the right order with the others, otherwise the script will not work.

In short, this is a custom script for me to work quicker.. That's all.
